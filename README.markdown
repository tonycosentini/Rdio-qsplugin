# RdioSilver - Quicksilver Plug-in for Rdio

**Note: I'm pretty sure that this plug-in no longer works with the current version of the Rdio app. I don't really use Quicksilver that much anymore so I don't plan on updating it.**

Heads up, this is extremely alpha. I've never written a Quicksilver plug-in before, and I've only tested this on my own machine.

If you want to give it a try, feel free to download the [binary](https://github.com/tonycosentini/Rdio-qsplugin/downloads). It should be compatible with OS X 10.6+.
