# RdioSilver - Quicksilver Plug-in for Rdio
Heads up, this is extremely alpha. I've never written a Quicksilver plug-in before, and I've only tested this on my own machine.

If you want to give it a try, feel free to download the [binary](https://github.com/tonycosentini/RdioSilver-qsplugin/downloads). It should be compatible is OS X 10.6+.
